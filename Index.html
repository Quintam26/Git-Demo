            <p>I am born and raised from Hood River, Oregon and I have 3 brothers and 3 sisters. Most of my upbringing I worked in the orchards and fields with my family to sustain ourselves.
                We were fortunate enough to have hardly moved from place to place. Instead we found ourselves living in cabins provided by the orchard owners. Looking back at those years
                makes me relive the simplicty and monotonous life we had. Back then I could never appreciate the development I had gone through at the that time. Now I'm here in the city amongst
                the many busy people trying to figure themselves out.</p>
