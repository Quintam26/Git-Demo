                <br>
                    <p>I was born and raised in Hood River, Oregon where many people admire it's natural beauty. 
                    Most of my upbringing I worked in the orchards and fields with my family to sustain ourselves.
                    We were fortunate enough to have hardly moved from place to place. 
                    Instead we found ourselves living in cabins provided by the orchard owners. Looking back at those years
                    makes me relive the simplicty and monotonous life we had. 
                    Back then I could never appreciate the development I had gone through at that time. 
                    Now I'm here in the city amongst the many busy people trying to figure themselves out.

                    <p> My family used to drive to Mexico from Oregon and as one can imagine it was a great distance.
                        Depending on the mental state of the driver, the weather conditions of each state, and
                        the duration of inspections, would ultimately determine the total time for the trip.
                        The following is a list of states that I have traveled to during said trips.</p>

                <br>
                    <p> I don't remember how early my interest in cars and racing began but I clearly reflect on the days I played Gran Turismo 2.
                        Of all the professional fields none have captivated my mind and drive like that of motorsports. I love to drive in all its forms whether it's in a car, in a video game,
                        or on a motorcycle. Last year I bought my first motorcyle and the thrill of riding it on stretches of pristine driving roads cannot be compared to anything. 
                        
                        
                        The physical sensation I need had also led me towards weightlifting as well. Slowly I have tested not only my body but my ability to learn on how to develop a stronger body.
                        Like many people, I simply moved the weight around without a thought, I continuously performed ineffective workouts, and I never questioned my eating habits.
