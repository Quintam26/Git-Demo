                <br>
                    <p>I was born and raised in Hood River, Oregon where many people admire it's natural beauty. 
                    Most of my upbringing I worked in the orchards and fields with my family to sustain ourselves.
                    We were fortunate enough to have hardly moved from place to place. 
                    Instead we found ourselves living in cabins provided by the orchard owners. Looking back at those years
                    makes me relive the simplicty and monotonous life we had. 
                    Back then I could never appreciate the development I had gone through at that time. 
                    Now I'm here in the city amongst the many busy people trying to figure themselves out.

                    <p> My family used to drive to Mexico from Oregon and as one can imagine it was a great distance.
                        Depending on the mental state of the driver, the weather conditions of each state, and
                        the duration of inspections, would ultimately determine the total time for the trip.
                        The following is a list of states that I have traveled to during said trips.</p>
