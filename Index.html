                <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>I was born and raised in Hood River, Oregon where many people admire it's natural beauty. 
                    Most of my upbringing I worked in the orchards and fields with my family to sustain ourselves.
                    We were fortunate enough to have hardly moved from place to place. 
                    Instead we found ourselves living in cabins provided by the orchard owners. Looking back at those years
                    makes me relive the simplicty and monotonous life we had. 
                    Back then I could never appreciate the development I had gone through at that time. 
                    Now I'm here in the city amongst the many busy people trying to figure themselves out.

                <h3>Experience</h3>
                    <p> I moved to Portland in 2009 to go to school. My choice was Portland State University since it was in the city itself.
